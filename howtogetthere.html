            <div class="dsdaqpch">

                <ul>
                    <p><strong>Acclimatization:</strong> The Colca Canyon is located at a considerable altitude. It is
                        recommended to acclimatize in Arequipa before traveling, or bring medication to help control
                        altitude sickness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reservations:</strong> Make reservations in advance for buses or tours, especially during
                        high season.</p>
                    <p><strong>Food and Water:</strong> Bring water and snacks, as some areas may not have nearby
                        stores.</p>
                    <p><strong>Money:</strong> Try to carry cash, as many places may not accept cards or mobile payment
                        apps.</p>
                    <p><strong>Plan Stops:</strong> Don't hesitate to stop at the viewpoints and towns along the way.
                        Each stop can offer you a unique and enriching experience.</p>
